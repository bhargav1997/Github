# Here's a simple table highlighting the key differences between Git and GitHub:

| Feature            | Git                                      | GitHub                                               |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Distributed version control system.       | Web-based platform that utilizes Git for version control.|
| **Usage**          | Used locally on a developer's machine.    | Hosts Git repositories in the cloud for collaboration.|
| **Repository Hosting** | No repository hosting, local only.     | Provides remote hosting for Git repositories.        |
| **Collaboration**  | Collaboration is done manually, sharing changes via email or other means. | Facilitates collaboration with features like pull requests, issues, and project management.|
| **Visibility**     | Local repositories are private by default.| GitHub allows public and private repositories, promoting open source collaboration.|
| **Access Control** | Limited access control options on a local machine.| GitHub offers granular access control with permissions and team management.|
| **Workflow Tools** | Basic command-line interface.             | Web-based interface with additional collaboration and project management tools.|
| **Social Features**| No built-in social features.               | Provides features like followers, activity feed, and notifications.|
| **Backup and Redundancy** | No automatic backup or redundancy.   | GitHub provides backup, redundancy, and disaster recovery.|
| **Community Support**| Limited community support.               | Large community support and extensive documentation.|

**Note: While Git is the version control system, GitHub is a platform built around Git to enhance collaboration and provide additional features.**
