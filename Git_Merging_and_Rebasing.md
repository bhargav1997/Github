# Git Merging and Rebasing Guide

## Introduction

- Git provides two main approaches for integrating changes from one branch into another: merging and rebasing. 
- Understanding when to use each method is crucial for maintaining a clean and efficient Git history.

## Merging

Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch, creating a new commit that represents the integration point. It's suitable for preserving the context of individual branches.

### Merging Steps

1. **Switch to the Target Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout target_branch
   ```

2. **Merge the Source Branch:**
   ```bash
   git merge source_branch
   ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
   If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them.

4. **Complete the Merge:**
   After resolving conflicts, commit the changes to complete the merge.

## Rebasing

Rebasing, on the other hand, integrates changes by moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It creates a linear Git history but should be used cautiously on shared branches.

### Rebasing Steps

1. **Switch to the Source Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout source_branch
   ```

2. **Rebase onto the Target Branch:**
   ```bash
   git rebase target_branch
   ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
   Similar to merging, conflicts may arise during rebasing.

4. **Complete the Rebase:**
   After resolving conflicts, commit the changes to complete the rebase.

## When to Use Each Approach

- **Use Merging:**
  - For integrating feature branches into the main branch.
  - When working on a collaborative project with shared branches.

- **Use Rebasing:**
  - For cleaning up the commit history and maintaining a linear timeline.
  - When working on a personal branch that hasn't been shared with others.

## Conclusion

Both merging and rebasing have their strengths and use cases. Choose the approach that aligns with your project's collaboration style and the desired structure of your Git history.
